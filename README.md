# Sentinel-1 InSAR Displacement Viewer

This module is part of the Signal Viewer project. It provides a web interface for processing and visualizing Sentinel-1 InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) data.  
The viewer reads NetCDF (`.nc`) files, extracts the unwrapped phase, and calculates the corresponding surface displacement map.

It is designed for researchers, engineers, or students working with radar-based ground deformation data.

---

## Overview

The Sentinel-1 InSAR Viewer allows you to:

- Upload a Sentinel-1 `.nc` InSAR dataset.
- Process the unwrapped phase to compute surface displacement in meters.
- Display an interactive heatmap of displacement values.
- View a histogram of displacement distribution.
- Inspect summary statistics (maximum, minimum, and mean displacement).

The interface is built with [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) and [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/), offering an interactive and lightweight analysis tool that runs locally in your browser.

---

## How It Works

1. The user uploads a `.nc` file containing Sentinel-1 InSAR data.
2. The app extracts the variable `unwrappedPhase` from the NetCDF group `science/grids/data`.
3. The surface displacement is computed using the formula:

   ```python
   displacement = (unwrapped_phase * wavelength) / (4 * np.pi)
````

where the wavelength (`λ`) is set to 0.056 m (C-band).

4. The processed displacement values are displayed as:

   * A color-coded **heatmap**.
   * A **histogram** of displacement values.
   * A **summary panel** with displacement statistics.
